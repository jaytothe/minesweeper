A simplified game of minesweeper using vanilla JavaScript

In this walkthrough, I show you how to build Minesweeper in pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

In addition to this, we will also be practicing using inbuilt methods such as:

addEventListener()
setAttribute()
fill()
setInterval()
some()
every()
forEach()
includes()
contains()
add()
remove()
createElement()
appendChild()
push()
Array()
continue
And many more.
